Data science is an interdisciplinary field that involves extracting insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data. It combines various domains such as statistics, mathematics, computer science, and domain-specific knowledge to analyze complex datasets and extract meaningful patterns, trends, and insights.

Key Concepts in Data Science:
Data: Data is the foundation of data science. It can be structured (organized in a tabular format) or unstructured (text, images, videos, etc.). Data can come from various sources such as sensors, social media, websites, or business transactions.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Before analysis, data often requires cleaning and preprocessing. This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and transforming data into a suitable format for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA involves analyzing and visualizing data to understand its underlying structure, patterns, and relationships. Techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices are commonly used in EDA.

Statistical Analysis: Statistical methods are used to summarize and interpret data. This includes descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) and inferential statistics (hypothesis testing, regression analysis) to make predictions or draw conclusions from data samples.

Machine Learning: Machine learning algorithms are used to build predictive models and make decisions based on data. This includes supervised learning (classification, regression), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction), and reinforcement learning.

Big Data: With the increasing volume, velocity, and variety of data generated, big data technologies such as Hadoop and Spark enable processing and analyzing large-scale datasets efficiently.

Data Visualization: Data visualization techniques such as charts, graphs, and dashboards are used to present data visually, making it easier to understand and interpret complex patterns and trends.

Techniques Used in Data Science:
Regression Analysis: Regression techniques are used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

Classification: Classification algorithms categorize data into predefined classes or categories based on input features.

Clustering: Clustering algorithms group similar data points together based on their characteristics or features.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP techniques are used to analyze and understand human language data, including tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and machine translation.

Deep Learning: Deep learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks, are used for complex pattern recognition tasks, including image and speech recognition.

Time Series Analysis: Time series analysis involves analyzing data collected over time to identify patterns, trends, and seasonal variations.

Applications of Data Science:
Business Intelligence: Data science is used in business for market segmentation, customer churn prediction, sales forecasting, and customer recommendation systems.

Healthcare: In healthcare, data science is used for disease prediction, medical image analysis, personalized medicine, and drug discovery.

Finance: Data science is used in finance for fraud detection, risk management, algorithmic trading, and credit scoring.

Marketing: Data science techniques are used in marketing for customer segmentation, campaign optimization, and social media analysis.

Internet of Things (IoT): Data science plays a crucial role in analyzing and extracting insights from the massive amounts of data generated by IoT devices.

Government and Public Policy: Data science is used in government and public policy for crime prediction, traffic optimization, and policy analysis.

# Call the introduce method

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('customer_reviews.csv')

# Data preprocessing
data['text'] = data['text'].str.lower()

# Feature extraction
tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(data['text'])
y = data['sentiment']

# Split data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Model training
model = LogisticRegression()

# Model evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Example usage
new_reviews = ["I absolutely loved the product!", "The product was terrible."]
new_reviews_tfidf = tfidf_vectorizer.transform(new_reviews)
predictions = model.predict(new_reviews_tfidf)
